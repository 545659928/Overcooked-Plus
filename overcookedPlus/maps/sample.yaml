'''
Args:
    name (str, required): The name assigned to this particular map configuration, consistent with the filename.
    dimensions (list, required): The size of the map grid, specified as the number of rows and columns.
    map (list, required): The initial static layout of the map, represented as a 2D list where each item is identified by its ITEMIDX value.
    max_n_agent (int, required): The maximum number of agents allowed in the simulation.
    dynamic_map (bool, required): Indicates if the map changes dynamically during the simulation.
    switch_map (list, optional): Alternate map layout to switch to after a certain number of steps, represented as a 2D list. Currently only supports changes in -1 blocks.
    map_switch_step (int, optional): The step number at which the map will switch to the alternate layout.
    agent_initial_coordinates (list, required): The starting positions of the agents on the map, each position specified as a [row, column] pair. The length cannot exceed max_n_agent.
